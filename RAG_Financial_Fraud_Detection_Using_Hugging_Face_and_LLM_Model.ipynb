This is because one of the signs of financial fraud is inaccurate financial records, where expenses and liabilities may be concealed or underreported to hide the true financial position of the organization. Therefore, if financial records accurately reflect all expenses and liabilities, it is less likely to be a sign of financial fraud.\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s essential to note that the absence of this sign does not necessarily indicate the absence of financial fraud. Other signs of financial fraud, such as unusual transactions, discrepancies in financial statements, and unexplained cash flows, should also be considered while analyzing financial text data.\\n\\nIn summary, the given statement is more likely to be found in non-fraud records, but further analysis is required to determine the likelihood of financial fraud.'}"
